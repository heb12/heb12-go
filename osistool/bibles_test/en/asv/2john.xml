        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth`s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, [even] they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into [your] house, and give him no greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thine elect sister salute thee.</verse>
