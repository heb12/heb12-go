        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man called his wife`s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother`s keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother`s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother`s blood from thy hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother`s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.46.32'>and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.33'>And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.34'>that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.47'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.1'>Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.2'>And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.3'>And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.4'>And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants` flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.5'>And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.6'>the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.7'>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.8'>And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.9'>And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.10'>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.11'>And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.12'>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father`s household, with bread, according to their families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.13'>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.14'>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh`s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.15'>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for [our] money faileth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.16'>And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.17'>And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.18'>And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord`s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.19'>wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.20'>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.21'>And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh`s servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed`s head.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>And Israel beheld Joseph`s sons, and said, Who are these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel`s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel`s right hand, and brought them near unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim`s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh`s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father`s hand, to remove it from Ephraim`s head unto Manasseh`s head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.49.5'>Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.6'>O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.7'>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.</verse>
